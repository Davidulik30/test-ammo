# This file used to contain a custom multiplayer spawner implementation.
# It has been intentionally replaced by the engine's built-in
# MultiplayerSpawner node and corresponding logic in
# `artilerry_scene.gd`.

# The file is left as an empty stub to avoid accidental imports. You
# can safely delete this file manually if you want it removed from
# version control.
